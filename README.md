# Cars-Detection-using-Haar-Cascade-in-OpenCv
This Python script uses OpenCV to detect cars in a video. It loads a Haar Cascade classifier, processes video frames, converts them to grayscale, detects cars using detectMultiScale, and highlights them with rectangles. Results display in real-time, with clean exit.
